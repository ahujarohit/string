**Mastering String in Java**

Welcome to "Mastering String in Java," an in-depth video series dedicated to exploring the various aspects of string handling in Java. This series covers everything from the basics to advanced topics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of string manipulation in Java. Here's a detailed description of each video in the series:

**Introduction to String Class and Constructors** 
We start with an introduction to the String class and its various constructors. You will learn how to create and initialize strings using different methods.

**Methods of String Class** 
Next, we cover the extensive range of methods provided by the String class. Each method will be demonstrated with practical examples to help you understand their usage and functionality.

**New Methods Introduced in Java 8, 9, 11, 12, and 15** 
Following that, we explore new methods introduced in the String class in Java 8, Java 9, Java 11, Java 12, and Java 15, providing detailed examples to showcase their practical applications.

**Permutations of Characters in a String** 
Using the String class, we implement a program to find permutations of characters in a string using recursive logic. This will help you understand how to manipulate strings to solve complex problems.

**String Constant Pool** 
We then discuss the String Constant Pool in detail, providing examples to illustrate how it works and its impact on performance.

**Methods to Create Strings and the intern() Method** 
Next, we explore various methods to create strings and the significance of the intern() method. You will learn how to optimize memory usage and improve the performance of your Java applications.

**Immutable Nature of Strings** 
We explain the immutable nature of Strings in Java, why this design choice was made, and the benefits it brings. We delve into the concept of immutability and its implications on string handling.

**StringBuffer and StringBuilder Classes** 
We then cover the StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes, their methods, and how they differ from the String class. We demonstrate their usage with examples, highlighting their advantages in different scenarios.

**StringJoiner Class** 
The series also includes an explanation of the StringJoiner class, its purpose, and usage, providing examples to show how it simplifies string concatenation tasks.

**StringTokenizer Class** 
We cover the StringTokenizer class, its methods, and provide practical examples to illustrate its use cases.

**String Class Interview Questions** 
To prepare you for job interviews, we go through various interview questions related to the String class, helping you tackle them confidently.

**Detailed Assignment on String Class** 
Finally, we provide a comprehensive assignment on the String class. This assignment includes real-world examples to practice and reinforce your learning. You can ask any doubts and queries through the WhatsApp number mentioned in the description or comments.
